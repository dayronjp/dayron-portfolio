## Vision and purpose
This portfolio was designed to clearly communicate **who I am** (an engineer in training), **what I build** (backend systems, automation, practical tools), and **how I think** (prioritizing maintainability, observability, and real-world impact).

Concrete goals:
- Present technical case studies with architectural decisions and outcomes.
- Demonstrate proficiency with modern practices (TypeScript, Next.js, MDX, CI/CD).
- Serve as a professional asset for recruiters, managers, and collaborators.
- Act as a foundation for technical discussions and interview evaluations.

## Target audience
- Recruiters and hiring managers seeking junior engineers with an engineering mindset.  
- Senior engineers evaluating code quality and technical decision-making.  
- Partners or mentors interested in collaboration on automation and infrastructure-related projects.

## Product and technical decisions
This project was built with deliberate choices to prioritize performance, maintainability, and readability:

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) — Static/SSG rendering where applicable for performance and SEO.
- **Language**: TypeScript — stronger type safety and predictable code.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS — consistent design and fast iteration.
- **Content**: MDX — enables rich documentation alongside project case studies.
- **Deployment**: Vercel — continuous deployment with GitHub integration and global CDN.
- **Accessibility & Performance**: responsive layout, optimized images, favicon, and social metadata.
- **Content architecture**: each project is an autonomous unit (frontmatter + MDX), simplifying SSG and content versioning.

## Portfolio highlights and content
- **Home**: professional summary, key metrics, and clear CTAs (Projects / Contact / Resume).  
- **Selected projects**: visual cards with covers, tech stack, and direct links to case studies.  
- **Project case pages**: problem statement, solution, architectural decisions, stack, and results.  
- **About**: professional background, skills, and selected certifications.  
- **Contact**: contact form via Formspree (no SMTP server), plus alternative contact channels (email, LinkedIn).  
- **Multilingual support (planned)**: English and Japanese for international opportunities.

## Featured case: JurisBridge (summary)
**JurisBridge — Legal Virtual Assistant (prototype)**  
- **Problem**: limited access to simplified legal guidance for vulnerable populations; complex and slow legal processes.  
- **Solution**: a virtual assistant prototype with guided intake and automated legal document generation, plus a tracking dashboard.  
- **Technology**: Python (backend & automation), React (frontend demo), API integrations, and automated content generation.  
- **Role**: prototyping, chatbot integration, automation workflows, and case presentation.  
- **Expected impact**: reduce initial triage workload, democratize access to legal information, and route complex cases to professionals.

> Note: the case presented on the site prioritizes clarity of the problem, technical justification, and design decisions — key indicators of engineering maturity.

## How to evaluate this portfolio (for recruiters)
If time is limited, follow this order:

1. **Home** — first impression and positioning clarity.  
2. **Selected Projects** — titles, summaries, and tech stack.  
3. **Project Case** (at least one) — problem → solution → decisions → results.  
4. **Commit history / diffs** (GitHub) — discipline, clarity, and consistency.  
5. **About & Certifications** — background and areas of focus.  
6. **Contact** — reach out via form or email for a quick introduction.

Key evaluation criteria: clarity of technical thinking, justified decisions, production-oriented mindset, and concise communication of impact.

## Roadmap / Next steps
Planned improvements for this portfolio:
- Full translation of main pages (EN / JP).  
- Custom Open Graph image for social sharing (LinkedIn).  
- Replace avatar with a professional photograph when available.  
- Anonymous analytics integration (e.g., Plausible) and performance monitoring.  
- Resume versions in EN / JP and a dedicated page for technical interviews.  
- Addition of unit and end-to-end tests for a selected demonstrative project.
